# Standardize Chronological Ordering for Session Message Ingestion and Timelines: Session History Compaction Routines Revert Boundary

These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE for all files matching the configured scope.

### Rules

- **R-CHRON-001** MUST: Session history compaction routines and revert boundary calculations MUST determine message sequence and cutoffs strictly by persistent creation timestamps.

### Verify

```bash
# Discover and run the project's test suite for session synchronization, timeline aggregation, and revert calculation
npx jest packages/app packages/tui packages/opencode packages/web
# Run repository linter and type-checker
npx turbo run lint type-check
```

**Accept when:**
- Sync reducers and timeline views sort messages strictly by creation timestamp even when supplied out-of-order test events.
- Transcript exports and revert boundary calculations produce deterministic outputs matching creation timestamp ordering across all packages.
